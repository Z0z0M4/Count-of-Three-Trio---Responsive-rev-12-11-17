	        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
	    		<h4><b>"On</b> the Count of Three provided the music for our wedding ceremony. As professional musicians ourselves, having high quality, live music was a must for us. Greg was very easy to work with and extremely professional. He provided us with a list of their repertoire as well as some sample recordings, from which we picked some songs. We also requested a song that wasn't on the list, which Greg was able to accommodate. We asked the trio to pick before/after music. When the ceremony came, everything came together perfectly. The music sounded great and we're so glad that we chose them. We would highly recommend them."</h4>

		      <h4><b>"Hiring</b> On the Count of Three was one of the first and easiest wedding decisions I made, almost as soon as the ring was on my finger! We had the group play for our ceremony and the cocktail hour. I received so many compliments about the quality of the music. Greg was very easy to work with, and had no problems creating beautiful arrangements of my obscure music choices. I really appreciated how stress free my experience was and can&lsquo;t recommend them enough!"</h4>
